# Card-Table
Casino Style Card Table.
Currently have implemented a casino style black jack game. Will do Texas Hold'em...
Allows player to make bets, double down, surrender bets.
Allows players to split first hand of the same card value.
Allows user input to define: number of players, number of decks.
I have also implemented a card count of the deck, keeps track of true count of deck, if you want to count cards.
