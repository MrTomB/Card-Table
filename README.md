Casino Style Card Table
Currently only black jack is implemented
Allows user input for number of players, number of decks, and bets.
Allows people to double down, surrender bets.
Allows people to split first hand if same card.
Allows people to keep track of true count, which implements basic card counting.

I am plaining on implementing Texas Holdem.
